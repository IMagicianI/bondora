# Analysis of Bondora lenders' data

Code for cleaning public [Bondora lender data](https://www.bondora.co.uk/en/invest/statistics/data_export) and running simple analyses on it. A summary of performed analyses is in raport.html (generated from raport.Rmd).

Probably the most reusable script here is [clean_data.R](https://github.com/taivop/bondora/blob/master/clean_data.R) that cleans the original data a little bit. Note that you need to convert the XLSX file provided by Bondora to a CSV file to use the script.
